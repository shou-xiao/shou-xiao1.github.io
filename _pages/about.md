I am a PhD student at Department of Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering (ECSE), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ([RPI](https://www.ecse.rpi.edu/)),  working  under the supervision of [Prof. Ali Tajer](https://www.isg-rpi.com/). I am broadly interested in causal inference using observational and interventional data, especially in high-dimensional causal graphs.

* My research interests include structure learning of high-dimensional graphical models and causal inference for multi-modality.  -->

I am a [2020 IBM AI Horizons Scholar](https://airc.rpi.edu/aih-scholars) as part of [RPI-IBM AI Research Collaboration](https://airc.rpi.edu/) and working with [Dr. Karthikeyan Shanmugam](https://sites.google.com/a/utexas.edu/karthiksh/) and [Dr. Prasanna Sattigeri](https://pronics2004.github.io/). 

Before joining RPI, I received my Bachelor's degree from [Electrical & Electronics Engineering](https://ee.boun.edu.tr/), [Bogazici University](http://www.boun.edu.tr/en-US/Index) in 2018.
