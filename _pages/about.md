I am a PhD student at Department of Mathematical Sciences, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ([RPI](https://www.ecse.rpi.edu/)),  working  under the supervision of [Prof. Kristin Bennett](https://homepages.rpi.edu/~bennek/). I am broadly interested in probabilistic machine learning, temporal event sequences, point process, natural language understanding and causal inference. My current research interests include modeling, causal inference, structural discovery and decision making for and from sequential data.

I am a [2020 IBM AI Horizons Scholar](https://airc.rpi.edu/aih-scholars) as part of [RPI-IBM AI Research Collaboration](https://airc.rpi.edu/) and working with [Dr. Dharmashankar Subramanian](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-dharmash), [Dr. Tian Gao](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-tgao) and [Dr. Debarun Bhattacharjya](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-debarunb)

Before joining RPI, I received my Bachelor's degree from [Wittenberg University](https://www.wittenberg.edu/) in 2012 and my Master's degree from [Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) in 2014.
