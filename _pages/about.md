I hold a PhD in Applied Math from Department of Mathematical Sciences, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ([RPI](https://science.rpi.edu/mathematical-sciences)),  working  under the supervision of [Prof. Kristin Bennett](https://homepages.rpi.edu/~bennek/). I am broadly interested in probabilistic machine/deep learning particularly in the domains of time series and temporal point processes, and their intersection with graphical models (i.e. Graphical Event Models). Additionally, I am also interested in causal machine learning, applied both in tabular and sequential data contexts, encompassing fields such as healthcare, recommendation systems, natural language understanding, among others. Beyond modeling, I am equally intrigued by the challenges of structure learning and decision-making processes when dealing with sequential data, particularly for health systems.

I am a [2020 IBM AI Horizons Scholar](https://airc.rpi.edu/aih-scholars) as part of [RPI-IBM AI Research Collaboration](https://airc.rpi.edu/) and working with [Dr. Dharmashankar Subramanian](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-dharmash), [Dr. Tian Gao](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-tgao) and [Dr. Debarun Bhattacharjya](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-debarunb)

Before joining RPI, I received my Bachelor's degree from [Wittenberg University](https://www.wittenberg.edu/) in 2012 and my Master's degree from [Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) in 2014.
